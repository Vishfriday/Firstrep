This html code is used for making phone calls. 
You can open the code in VS code or whatever code editor you're comfortable with and change the mobile number with your collaborators number and also include many more phone numbers.
Thus you need to spend some seconds opening the phone, picking the number.
The syntax for phone call in html is <a href="tel:phone number">Any name</a>
